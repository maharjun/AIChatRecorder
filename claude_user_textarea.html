   w-full" data-1p-ignore="true">The hole in this CAD geometry is a defect and must be filled. This image contains labeled vertexes in the geometry. Your task is to select all and only those vertexes that are immediately adjacent to the hole. Some vertex indices refer to vertexes that share the same position. Ensure all included vertexes refer to distinct points and pay attention to the red line to see where they point to. Use the following train of thought:

1. List each vertex and describe their position relative to the hole, as well as mention other vertexes sharing the same position.
2. Select only those vertexes that are immediately adjacent to the hole.
3. Pick a subset of these vertexes such that each vertex refers to a unique position (look at the red lines)
